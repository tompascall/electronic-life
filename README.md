This project is based on one of the project [http://eloquentjavascript.net/07_elife.html](electronic life) of the book [Marijn Haverbeke: Eloquent Javascript (second edition)](eloquentjavascript.net).

The program runs under node.js.

To start it you have to install node.js globally, then type `node index.js` in the project library.
